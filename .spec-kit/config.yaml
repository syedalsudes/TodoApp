# Todo App – Claude Code Instructions (Root)

## Project Context
This is a monorepo using Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven development.
All features must be implemented strictly according to specs.

## Specs Location
All specs are located in /specs:

- overview.md
- features/
- api/
- database/
- ui/

## How to Work
1. Read relevant spec file
2. Implement exactly what is described
3. Do not add extra features
4. Do not write placeholder code
5. Follow project structure strictly

## Workflow
- Specs define behavior
- Claude Code generates implementation
- Specs are updated if behavior changes

## Stack Overview
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router)
- Backend: FastAPI
- ORM: SQLModel
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Auth: Better Auth (JWT)
